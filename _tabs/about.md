# Hi
I've had the pleasure of operating Blue Team in cybersecurity for almost 7 years, and have been in IT for about 15 years in total. I am married to a beautiful and supporting wife and the proud parent of 3 asshole cats, a dog, and a lot of plants. 

This site will be focused on cybersecurity, including various ctf writeups, offensive security methodology, and other related things. Feel free to reach out or connect with me.
