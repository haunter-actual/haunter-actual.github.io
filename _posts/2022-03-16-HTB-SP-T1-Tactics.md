## Introduction

Tactics is the last target in the tier 1 group. We'll be enumerating SMB again here.

### tl;dr                                                                                      
<details>                                                                                      
  <summary>Spoiler!</summary>                                                                  
 
   1. Scan with the `-Pn` switch.<br/>                                    
   2. Enumerate the `smb` shares with `smbclient -L $target -U Administrator` <br/>
   3. Connect to `//$target/C$` and navigate to the admin's desktop<br/>
   4. `GET flag.txt` and `cat` it locally <br/>

## Establishing a Connection & Initial Scan

Spawn the bastard and get vpn going.

I've confirmed the target is reachable with a `ping`.

Start the default `nmap` scan and let it run while we complete the tasklist.

## The Tasklist

### Task 1
#### Which Nmap switch can we use to enumerate machines when our packets are otherwise blocked by the Windows firewall?

Curiously, this is the first time our default scan returned ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

Fortunately `nmap` offers a tip below to use the `-Pn` switch in this scenario.

Our modified `nmap` command now reads `nmap -Pn -A -v -T4 -oA recon/all $target`

We know have some intel :)

### Task 2
#### What does the 3-letter acronym SMB stand for?

`server message block`

### Task 3
#### What port does SMB use to operate at?

`445`

### Task 4 
#### What command line argument do you give to `smbclient` to list available shares?

We covered `smb` enumeration back in [Dancing](https://opfor-haunter.github.io/posts/HTB-SP-T0-Dancing/). 

`-L`

### Task 5
#### What character at the end of a share name indicates it's an administrative share?

`$`

### Task 6
#### Which Administrative share is accessible on the box that allows users to view the whole file system?

<img src='/assets/img/ctf/htb/sp/tier1/tactics/2smbclient.png'/>

1. Firstly, we try to enumerate as was mentioned in Task 4. However, we did not have permissions to conduct discovery.
2. Using -U Administrator, we were then successfully able to enumerate the shares.

1. I was able to connect to each of the three shares, but `ADMIN$` and `IPC$` were dead ends.
2. `C$` was more lucrative.
3. `ls` showed this was the answer

### Task 7
#### What command can we use to download the files we find on the SMB Share?

`GET`

### Task 8
#### Which tool that is part of the Impacket collection can be used to get an interactive shell on the system?

Impacket has a script called `psexec.py`. It is an alternative to the `smbclient` session, but it is not needed here.

### Task 9
####  Submit root flag

## Capturing the Flag

<img src='/assets/img/ctf/htb/sp/tier1/tactics/3flag.png'/>

1. We `cd` down to `Administrator`'s Desktop
2. `ls` reveals `flag.txt`
3. and we download it with `GET flag.txt`

Once we exit the smb session, we can `cat` the flag and call it a win.

## Lessons Learned

* Impacket has a bunch of useful tools worth checking out
